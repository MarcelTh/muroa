CRootItem needs a copy c-tor 
  test if newly added revisions (by applying a patch) leave the original revision unchanged.
  
Save / restore:
  save playlist and nextlist into files, one for each revision.
  
Track dependancies:
  A playlist revision depends on a mediaCol revision
  A nextlist revision on mediaCol revision OR playlist revision OR both. (a single nextlist item 
  depends on one OR the other, but if it depends on a playlist item, that depends on mediaCol item)
  dependancies must be saved and restored in stateDB
  If an Item is removed from mediaCol -> check if it must be removed from playlist AND nextlist, 
  too. May leed to new revision of playlist and nectlist.
  If anItem is removed from playlist -> check if it is referenced in the nextlist and generate a new 
  nexlist revision, too.
  
Signal Handling:
  make msessiond shutdown cleanly on reception of SIGTERM
  
Is serialize asDiff neccessary?
  the plus sign is at the wrongplace anyway. e.g. CMediaItem::serialize(asDiff=true) prepends 
  a plus sign (what about the minus sign?) in front of its own serialisation, but the category 
  path will be prepended afterwards. The the plus sign is in the middle.
